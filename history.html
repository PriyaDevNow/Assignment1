          <h4 class="card-title">Barbican & Le Bas Court</h4>
          <p class="card-text">The Barbican street name which has French origins first began to appear from the late 13th century - perhaps in reference to a pulled down watch-tower on this site but whose walled enclosure remained and became known as Le/La Bas Court.</p>
          <p class="card-text">In February 1331, Edward III granted to his trusted adviser Robert de Ufford (1298-1369) 'during pleasure, of the gardens and other appurtances, called 'la Bas Court, by Cryplegate, London' (cat Pal R 1330-4, 73).  Edward III had confisticated these from John Mautravers (c.1290—
           1364), considered to have become Lord Maltravers by 1330, who was indicted in his absence for plotting the death of the Earl of Kent. His lands, including the Barbican, were confiscated and he fled abroad in December 1330 (Shenton 2004).</p>
           <p class="card-text">Upon his death, Robert de Ufford left le Bas Court to his son William.  However, William died suddenly in 1382 without any issue and his sister Cicely inherited Bas Coourt.</p>
           <p class="card-text">Cicely (died c.1372) married John, 3rd Lord Willoughby de Eresby (c1328-72).   In William's will, Bas Court is described as 'A tenement with a garden and 13 shops with solars built thereon' and in addition there were in the ‘suburbs of London. 10 shops with gardens annexed on the west side of
            a street called 'Goldynglane', together with <strong>'a garden containing 2 a. land adjacent to the said gardens on the west side thereof'</strong> (Dawes et al 1970, 239—56). This seems to be the first demarcation of Bridgewater Square.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Bas Court and the surrounding properties continued in the Willoughby de Eresby family.  In 1516 William (1482—1526), 10th Lord Willoughby de Eresby, married as his second wife Maria
              de Salinas (d 1539), Spanish noblewoman and courtier, and lady in waiting to Katherine of Aragon (consort of Henry VIII 1509—33). They had a daughter, Katherine Willoughby de Eresby (1519—80), and it is
              from Katherine's time that most information about the Barbican is found.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title">Katherine de Willoughby</h4>
          <p class="card-text"> When William Willoughby died in 1526, as his only child, Katherine inherited his barony, becoming a baroness in her own right.  Katherine was married off as the fourth wife of
            Charles Brandon (1484—1545), 1st Duke of Suffolk, in October 1533 when she was only fourteen.  Katherine had two sons with
            Brandon, Henry (b 1535) and Charles (b 1537/8). Henry was born in the Barbican, where Katherine's mother was still living,
            when Katherine was still only fifteen (Goff 1930, 37). Both Henry and Charles were to die of sweating sickness in 1551, ending
            Brandon's direct line (Gunn 2015).</p>
          <p class="card-text">As Brandon himself had died in 1545, Katherine married again in 1552, this time of her own choosing to her gentleman usher, Richard
              Bertie (1517—82), with whom she also had two children, Susan (b 1554) and Peregrine (1555—1601).</p> 
          <p class="card-text">As staunch Protestants, Katherine and Richard Bertie were obliged to flee to the Continent in 1555 during the Marian Roman
            Catholic revival (1553—8). There is an account by Richard Bertie, who had carefully prepared for their flight abroad, of Katherine’s escape
            from their house at the Barbican on 1 January 1555, where Queen Mary had installed the royal official Edmond Atkinson (Somerset
            Herald 1550—70) to watch over her.</p>
          <p class="card-text">There is a lease dated to 21 October 1554 'leasing 'their Manor place called the Barbicane', all its gardens, buildings and
              appurtenances, all the tenements and houses belonging to it at Golding Lane and, in the parish of St Botolph without Aldersgate,
              at Darnoldes on Charterhouse Lane, to Edmond Atkinson, Somerset Herald, for a period of 21 years at £30, £8 for the Barbican itself (2-ANC 1/43/5).1</p>
